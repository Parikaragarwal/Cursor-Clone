# Cursor-Clone
This is a clone of the Cursor website's landing page created by using only HTML and CSS.

The clone as some limitations due to restricted tech stack. 
Firstly the font is taken from Cursor's original repo - the CursorGothic style. The folder had been cloned and the styles were imported from style.css of that repository.

The assets folder contains the screenshots of the interactive sections. The images are used directly.

The website is not responsive but due to limited tech stack and design constraints it was difficult to acheive.

The font used consistantly is the original : Cursor Gothic style.
The colors were discerened using a web extension and hence should be pretty accurate.

The main background color was : background-color: #14120B;
And the main color for text was : color: #ffffff;

Other colors like for links : color:#f54f02; were also used.

For buttons background color used was : color: #ffffff;

Each and every section from the Cursor Website have been recreated as closely as possible with the intent to study pixel perfect design philosophy. Since I am using Linux - the download button shows - Download for Linux. For Windows or MacOS it might show differently.

Feel free to visit the deployment and check the website looks. 
Please look out for any extensions and if possible open the website in a separate environment for best experience.
